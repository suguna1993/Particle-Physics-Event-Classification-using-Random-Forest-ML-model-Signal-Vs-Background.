**Problem Statement:**

In the field of particle physics, accurate identification and classification of events are crucial for understanding fundamental particles and their interactions. 

The provided dataset contains various features derived from particle physics experiments, and the goal is to build a machine-learning model to classify events into signal (s) and background (b) categories. 

This classification aids in distinguishing events of interest (signal) from background noise.


**Objective/Goal:**

The primary goal of this machine learning project is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether a given set of experimental features corresponds to a signal or background event.

Successful classification contributes to the advancement of particle physics research by automating the identification of events that may indicate the presence of specific particles or phenomena.

PRI_tau_phi: Azimuthal angle of the tau.Azimuthal angle defines the rotation of a particle's trajectory around the beamline. This feature represents the azimuthal angle of the tau particle, indicating its orientation in the transverse plane.

PRI_lep_pt: Transverse momentum of the lepton.Similar to PRI_tau_pt, this feature represents the transverse momentum of the lepton (electron or muon) in the event.

PRI_lep_eta: Pseudorapidity of the lepton.Similar to PRI_tau_eta, this feature indicates the pseudorapidity of the lepton, providing information about its angular position relative to the beamline.

PRI_lep_phi: Azimuthal angle of the lepton.Similar to PRI_tau_phi, this feature represents the azimuthal angle of the lepton, indicating its orientation in the transverse plane.

PRI_met: Missing transverse energy.Missing transverse energy is a crucial concept in particle physics. It represents the imbalance in transverse energy in an event, suggesting the presence of undetected particles or neutrinos.

PRI_met_phi: Azimuthal angle of the missing transverse energy.Similar to PRI_tau_phi and PRI_lep_phi, this feature represents the azimuthal angle of the missing transverse energy, indicating its orientation in the transverse plane.

PRI_met_sumet: Sum of the transverse energy of all objects in the event.This feature represents the sum of the transverse energy (energy component perpendicular to the beamline) of all objects (particles) detected in the event. It provides a measure of the overall energy flow in the transverse plane.

PRI_jet_num: Number of jets in the event.Indicates the count of jets observed in the event. Jets are collimated sprays of particles resulting from high-energy interactions. Knowing the number of jets is crucial for understanding the event's characteristics.

PRI_jet_leading_pt: Transverse momentum of the leading jet.Represents the transverse momentum of the jet with the highest transverse momentum in the event. The leading jet is the one with the most significant momentum contribution.

PRI_jet_leading_eta: Pseudorapidity of the leading jet.Indicates the pseudorapidity (angular position) of the leading jet, providing information about its direction in the detector.

PRI_jet_leading_phi: Azimuthal angle of the leading jet.Represents the azimuthal angle of the leading jet, indicating its orientation in the transverse plane.

PRI_jet_subleading_pt: Transverse momentum of the subleading jet.Represents the transverse momentum of the second-highest transverse momentum jet in the event (subleading jet).

PRI_jet_subleading_eta: Pseudorapidity of the subleading jet.Indicates the pseudorapidity of the subleading jet, providing information about its angular position in the detector.

PRI_jet_subleading_phi: Azimuthal angle of the subleading jet.Represents the azimuthal angle of the subleading jet, indicating its orientation in the transverse plane.

PRI_jet_all_pt: Sum of the transverse momentum of all jets in the event.This feature represents the sum of the transverse momentum of all jets detected in the event. It provides a measure of the overall transverse momentum contributed by all jets.

Weight: A weight associated with each event.The weight is a numerical value assigned to each event. It is often used as a scaling factor to account for the significance or importance of each event in the analysis. The weight may be applied during training and evaluation to adjust the contribution of each event to the model.

**-- ** TARGET ** --**

Target column(Label): The target variable, indicating the class or label of each event (s or b). This is the target variable where each event is labeled as either signal (s) or background (b).
